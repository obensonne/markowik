Here is a !WikiWord which should be escaped.

In links, [http://foo.bar WikiWords] must not be escaped.

This will end up as an HTML link, i.e. !FooBar must be escaped: <a href="http://foo.bar">Here _is !FooBar_</a>. As in this link: <a href="http://foo.bar">!CheckThis</a>.

_!WikiWords_ may be emphasized.

`A WikiWord in MonoSpace` does not need to be escaped.

All these must be escaped: !WikiWord,!FooBar:!DingDong/!HansPeter#!BarFoo?!HeyHo!!DuDa
