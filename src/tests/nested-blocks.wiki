GCW does not support subsequent nested paragraphs because the empty lines which separate paragraphs stop the nesting environment (a list or a blockquote). Markowik works around this issue by connecting nested paragraphs with the HTML tag `<br/>` on a line of its own.

Lets check some nesting madness:

  * item 1
  * item 2 consists of
  two paragraphs
  * item 3 consists of
    a blockquote with
    <br/>
    two paragraphs
  a paragraph
    and a blockquote with
      a nested blockquote
      <br/>
      which has two paragraphs
    this is a paragraph in the second blockquote of list item 3
      * this is a list
      * in the second blockquote of list item 3
      PyMD 2.1 supports paragraphs in lists nested in blockquotes
      * well done!

3-level blockquote nesting:

  level 1, paragraph 1
  <br/>
  level 1, paragraph 2
    level 2, paragraph 1
    <br/>
    level 2, paragraph 2
      level 3, paragraph 1
      <br/>
      level 3, paragraph 2
      {{{
a code block
in level 3
      }}}
