=== Simple ===

Let's check some _markup_. This is `monospace`. Here are `several monospace words`. What about _emphasized_ and _emphasized_ and *bold* and *bold*?

Nested _markups *are* also *possible*_.

{{{
Markups *do not*
apply in `code blocks`...
}}}

... nor in `monospace *text* parts`. Though, _emphasized `monospace` is possible_.

=== Empty lines and whitespace in verbatim environments ===

Repeating `whitespace in monospace` is not preserved as GCW ignores them. This also applies when `monospace crosses multiples lines`.

{{{
Empty lines in code blocks should be preserved.

But PyMD compresses them to *one* empty line.
}}}

=== Typefacing at Linebreaks ===

Here _is !FooBar_

_Here_ is !FooBar

_Here *is !FooBar*_.
