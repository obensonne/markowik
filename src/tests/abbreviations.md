### Extension Example ###

The HTML specification
is maintained by the W3C.

*[HTML]: Hyper Text Markup Language
*[W3C]:  World Wide Web Consortium

### Special Characters ###

The abbreviation extension does not recognize abbreviations with non-ASCII
characters, e.g. FÖÖ. This one works: LOO. And THIS.

*[LÖÖ]: Two bugs in a box
*[LOO]: Two *blind* "bügs in a box"

*[THIS]: Mixing 'single' and "double" quotes

Do you see a need for more tricky tests?
